# ASE_420_Team_Tetris_Project

This repository contains a functional Tetris game with two different versions: **V1.0** and **V2.0**.

## Current Status

The Tetris game is currently in a working state. Two versions of the game are available in the repository, each representing different stages of development.

---

## Version 1.0

**V1.0** is the initial implementation of the Tetris game. It includes the core logic required for the game to run. However, it is **very limited in functionality and not suitable for actual gameplay**. This version serves more as a proof of concept or base for further development.

---

## Version 2.0

**V2.0** is a significant improvement over V1.0. It includes the complete functionality expected of a Tetris game and is **fully playable**. While it still focuses solely on the Tetris game mechanics, it provides a much better user experience compared to the earlier version.
