# Tetris BOOM

Tetris BOOM is a modern and enhanced interpretation of the classic Tetris experience.  
This project reimagines traditional gameplay by introducing new mechanics, visual customization options, and player-focused features that elevate the timeless puzzle game.

---

## Problem
- Classic Tetris has become predictable.  
- Gameplay has not evolved significantly over the years.  
- It struggles to compete with modern, fast-paced puzzle games.

---

## Solution
By combining traditional Tetris mechanics with elements from highly engaging games like **Block Blast**, we introduce a fresh and dynamic twist.  
This creates a more interactive, strategic, and polished experience for players.
